            <em>“<strong>Hope</strong>” is the thing with feathers - <br>

            <br>
            And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard - <br>
            And sore must be the storm - <br>

            That kept so many warm - <br>
            <br>
            I’ve heard it in the chillest land - <br>
            And on the strangest Sea - <br>

            It asked a crumb - of me. <br></em>

            <em><p id="poem_2_part_1">I. The Burial of the Dead</p>
            <p>
            <strong>April</strong> is the cruellest month, breeding<br>
            Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br>
            Memory and desire, stirring<br>
            Dull roots with spring rain.<br>
            Winter kept us warm, covering<br>
            Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br>
            A little life with dried tubers.<br>
            Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br>
            With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br>
            And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<br>
            And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br>
            Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br>
            And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,<br>
            My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,<br>
            And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br>
            Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br>
            In the mountains, there you feel free.<br>
            I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.<br>
            <br>
            What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br>
            Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,<br>
            You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br>
            A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br>
            And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br>

            There is shadow under this red rock,<br>
            (Come in under the shadow of this red rock)<br>,
            And I will show you something different from either<br>
            Your shadow at morning striding behind you<br>
            Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;<br>
            I will show you fear in a handful of dust.<br>

            Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br>
            With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,<br>

              Unreal City,<br>
            Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br>
            A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many<br>,
            I had not thought death had undone so many.<br>
            Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br>
            And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.<br>
            Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,<br>
            To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br>
            With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.<br>
            There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!<br>
            “You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!<br>
            “That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br>
            “Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br>

            The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,<br>
            Glowed on the marble, where the glass<br>
            Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines<br>
            From which a golden Cupidon peeped out<br>
            (Another hid his eyes behind his wing)<br>
            Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra<br>
            Reflecting light upon the table as<br>
            The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,<br>
            From satin cases poured in rich profusion;<br>
            In vials of ivory and coloured glass<br>
            Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,<br>
            Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused<br>
            And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air<br>
            That freshened from the window, these ascended<br>
            In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,<br>
            Flung their smoke into the laquearia,<br>
            Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.<br>
            Huge sea-wood fed with copper<br>
            Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,<br>
            In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam.<br>
            Above the antique mantel was displayed<br>
            As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br>
            The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king<br>
            So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale<br>
            Filled all the desert with inviolable voice<br>
            And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br>
            “Jug Jug” to dirty ears.<br>
            And other withered stumps of time<br>
            Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br>
            Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br>
            Footsteps shuffled on the stair.<br>
            Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br>
            Spread out in fiery points<br>
            Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.<br>
            <br>

              I think we are in rats’ alley<br>

              When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—<br>
            I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,<br>
            HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
            Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.<br>
            He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you<br>
            To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.<br>
            You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,<br>
            He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.<br>
            And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,<br>
            He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,<br>
            And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.<br>
            Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.<br>
            Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.<br>

            If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.<br>
            Others can pick and choose if you can’t.<br>
            But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.<br>
            You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.<br>
            (And her only thirty-one.)<br>
            I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,<br>
            It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.<br>
            (She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)<br>
            The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.<br>
            You are a proper fool, I said.<br>
            Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,<br>
            What you get married for if you don’t want children?<br>
            HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br>
            Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,<br>
            And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—<br>

              The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf<br>
            Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind<br>
            Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.<br>
            Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br>
            The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,<br>
            Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends<br>
            Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.<br>
            And their friends, the loitering heirs of city<br> directors;<br>
            Departed, have left no addresses.<br>
            By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .<br>
            Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,<br>
            Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.<br>
            But at my back in a cold blast I hear<br>
            The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.<br>
            <br>
            A rat crept softly through the vegetation<br>
            Dragging its slimy belly on the bank<br>
            While I was fishing in the dull canal<br>
            On a winter evening round behind the gashouse<br>
            Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck<br>
            And on the king my father’s death before him.<br>
            White bodies naked on the low damp ground<br>
            And bones cast in a little low dry garret,<br>
            Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.<br>
            But at my back from time to time I hear<br>
            The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring<br>
            Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.<br>
            O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter<br>
            And on her daughter<br>
            They wash their feet in soda water<br>

            Under the brown fog of a winter noon<br>
            Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant<br>
            Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants<br>
            C.i.f. London: documents at sight,<br>
            Asked me in demotic French<br>
            To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel<br>
            Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.<br>
            <br>
            At the violet hour, when the eyes and back<br>
            Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits<br>
            Like a taxi throbbing waiting,<br>
            I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,<br>
            Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see<br>
            At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives<br>
            Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,<br>
            The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights<br>
            Her stove, and lays out food in tins.<br>
            Out of the window perilously spread<br>
            Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,<br>
            On the divan are piled (at night her bed)<br>
            Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.<br>
            I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs<br>
            Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—<br>
            I too awaited the expected guest.<br>
            He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,<br>
            A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,<br>
            One of the low on whom assurance sits<br>
            As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.<br>
            The time is now propitious, as he guesses,<br>
            The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,<br>
            Endeavours to engage her in caresses<br>
            Which still are unreproved, if undesired.<br>
            Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;<br>
            Exploring hands encounter no defence;<br>
            His vanity requires no response,<br>
            And makes a welcome of indifference.<br>

            Bestows one final patronising kiss,<br>
            And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .<br>
            <br>    
            She turns and looks a moment in the glass,<br>
            Hardly aware of her departed lover;<br>
            Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:<br>
            “Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”<br>

            Paces about her room again, alone,<br>
            She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,<br>
            And puts a record on the gramophone.<br>

            “This music crept by me upon the waters”<br>
            And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.<br>
            O City city, I can sometimes hear<br>
            Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,<br>
            The pleasant whining of a mandoline<br>
            <!--500 Lines of Code!!!-->
            And a clatter and a chatter from within<br>
            Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls<br>

            Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.<br>

              After the torchlight red on sweaty faces<br>
            After the frosty silence in the gardens<br>
            After the agony in stony places<br>
            The shouting and the crying<br>
            Prison and palace and reverberation<br>
            Of thunder of spring over distant mountains<br>
            He who was living is now dead<br>
            We who were living are now dying<br>
            With a little patience<br>
            <br>    
            Here is no water but only rock<br>
            Rock and no water and the sandy road<br>
            The road winding above among the mountains<br>
            Which are mountains of rock without water<br>
            If there were water we should stop and drink<br>
            Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think<br>
            Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand<br>
            If there were only water amongst the rock<br>
            Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit<br>
            Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit<br>
            There is not even silence in the mountains<br>
            But dry sterile thunder without rain<br>
            There is not even solitude in the mountains<br>
            But red sullen faces sneer and snarl<br>
            From doors of mudcracked houses<br>
            If there were water<br>
            And no rock<br>
            If there were rock<br>
            And also water<br>
            And water<br>
            A spring<br>
            A pool among the rock<br>
            If there were the sound of water only<br>
            Not the cicada<br>
            And dry grass singing<br>
            But sound of water over a rock<br>
            Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees<br>
            Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop<br>
            But there is no water<br>
            <br>    
            Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br>
            When I count, there are only you and I together<br>
            But when I look ahead up the white road<br>
            There is always another one walking beside you<br>
            Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded<br>
            I do not know whether a man or a woman<br>
            —But who is that on the other side of you?<br>
            <br>    
            What is that sound high in the air<br>
            Murmur of maternal lamentation<br>
            Who are those hooded hordes swarming<br>
            Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth<br>
            Ringed by the flat horizon only<br>
            What is the city over the mountains<br>
            Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air<br>
            Falling towers<br>
            Jerusalem Athens Alexandria<br>
            Vienna London<br>
            Unreal<br>
            <br>    
            A woman drew her long black hair out tight<br>
            And fiddled whisper music on those strings<br>
            And bats with baby faces in the violet light<br>
            Whistled, and beat their wings<br>
            And crawled head downward down a blackened wall<br>
            And upside down in air were towers<br>
            Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours<br>
            And voices singing out of empty cisterns and<br> exhausted wells.<br>
            <br>
            In this decayed hole among the mountains<br>
            In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing<br>
            Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel<br>
            There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.<br>
            It has no windows, and the door swings,<br>
            Dry bones can harm no one.<br>
            Only a cock stood on the rooftree<br>
            Co co rico co co rico<br>
            In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust<br>
            Bringing rain<br>
            <br>
            Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves<br>
            Waited for rain, while the black clouds<br>
            Gathered far distant, over Himavant.<br>
            The jungle crouched, humped in silence.<br>
            Then spoke the thunder<br>
            DA<br>
            Datta: what have we given?<br>
            My friend, blood shaking my heart<br>
            The awful daring of a moment’s surrender<br>
            Which an age of prudence can never retract<br>
            By this, and this only, we have existed<br>
            Which is not to be found in our obituaries<br>
            Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider<br>
            Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor<br>
            In our empty rooms<br>
            DA<br>
            Dayadhvam: I have heard the key<br>
            Turn in the door once and turn once only<br>
            We think of the key, each in his prison<br>
            Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison<br>
            Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours<br>
            Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus<br>
            DA<br>
            Damyata: The boat responded<br>
            Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar<br>
            The sea was calm, your heart would have responded<br>
            Gaily, when invited, beating obedient<br>
            To controlling hands<br>
            <br>     
            I sat upon the shore<br>
            Fishing, with the arid plain behind me<br>
            Shall I at least set my lands in order?<br>
            London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            You may write me down in history<br>
            With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>
            You may trod me in the very dirt<br>
            But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>
            <br>
            Does my sassiness upset you?<br>
            Why are you beset with gloom?<br>
            ’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>
            Pumping in my living room.<br>
            <br>
            Just like moons and like suns,<br>
            With the certainty of tides,<br>
            Just like hopes springing high,<br>
            Still I'll rise.<br>
            <br>
            Did you want to see me broken?<br>
            Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br>
            Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br>
            Weakened by my soulful cries?<br>
            <br>
            Does my haughtiness offend you?<br>
            Don't you take it awful hard<br>
            ’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br>
            Diggin’ in my own backyard.<br>
            <br>
            You may shoot me with your words,<br>
            You may cut me with your eyes,<br>
            You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br>
            But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br>
            <br>
            Does my sexiness upset you?<br>
            Does it come as a surprise<br>
            That I dance like I've got diamonds<br>
            At the meeting of my thighs?<br>
            <br>
            Out of the huts of history’s shame<br>
            I rise<br>
            Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br>
            I rise<br>
            I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br>
            Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>
            <br>
            Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>
            I rise
            Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br>
            I rise<br>
            Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>
            I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>
            I rise<br>
            I rise<br>
            I rise.</p></em>

                        Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>                        
                        Fallen cold and dead.<br>

                        For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>
                        For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
                        Here Captain! dear father!<br>
